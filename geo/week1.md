All of the Geosci 100 “Road Maps”, “Pair & Share” exercises, and “Free Exam Questions” we answer during class. 

# The concept of “Deep” Time.

# The Earth System (Ch. 1)

Split Earth system into two to simpfly:

- Surficial Earth System
- Deep Earth System

6371 km is the radius of the earth

Which on the following is true:

- Sometimes textbooks are wrong
- Science is in a constant state of revision
- Humans make errors
- **All of the above**

What is the approximate amount of elevation change (relief) between the highest (Mt. Everest) and the lowest (Marianas Trench) points on the surface of the earth?i

- About 2 km 
- About 5 km 
- **About 20 km** 
- About 50 km 

True or False: On average, the depth of the oceans below sea level is greater than the elevation of the continents above sea level

- **True** 
- False 

71% of the surface of the earth is water!

Warmer air holds more water, a lot of moisture is near the equator. 

Solid inner (iron 94%) core, same size of moon
Liquid other core, same size of mars
Mantle (oxygen, silicon, magnesium)
Crust (oxygen, silicon)

Why is iron concentrated in the core?
It's denser (Density = mass/vol), sinks faster

46% of the continental crust is oxygen, while only 21% of the atmosphere is oxygen. How could this be? 

- The crust has a lot of holes filled with oxygen gas 
- Volcanoes suck oxygen into the Earth’s interior 
- **Most of the crust is made up of solid silica tetrahedra**

Copper discovered 11k years ago
Gold 8k years ago

Continental crust differs from oceanic crust in which of the following characteristics:

- Thickness
- Density 
- Composition
- **All of the above**
