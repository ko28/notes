All of the Geosci 100 “Road Maps”, “Pair & Share” exercises, and “Free Exam Questions” we answer during class. 

# Wisconsin is moving, and always has been. How do we know this?
Pair and Share: How would you determine that the continents of the Earth are moving?
I think you can dig up rocks and fossils and see if they are similar to other continents. 
 
Triangulation
- Need 3 satellites
- Send message and share time 
- Three circles, where do they match up?

Vectors (length, direction)

458 million years ago WI was a ~tropical~ paradise

# Why does Plate Tectonics occur?

Tectonics: Large scale movements of earth's crust

Plate tectonics: Large scale movements of plates of earth's crusts

How did Alfred Wegener come up with the THE CONTINENTAL DRIFT HYPOTHESIS?:
- Continental Fit
- Fossil Distrubition 
- Similar Rock Patterns and Geologic Features (Stratigraphic Column)

How do ocean crusts/continents move?
~SEAFLOOR SPREADING~

Continental drift + sea floor spreading = plate tectonics

The Theory of Plate Tectonics involves which of the
following?:
A. Continental Drift and Evolution.
B. Seafloor Spreading and the Modern Synthesis.
C. Evolution and the Modern Synthesis.
D. **Continental Drift and Seafloor Spreading**

# The 7 types of plate boundaries






Split Earth system into two to simpfly:
- Surficial Earth System
- Deep Earth System

6371 km is the radius of the earth

Which on the following is true:
- Sometimes textbooks are wrong
- Science is in a constant state of revision
- Humans make errors
- **All of the above**

What is the approximate amount of elevation change (relief) between the highest (Mt. Everest) and the lowest (Marianas Trench) points on the surface of the earth?i
- About 2 km 
- About 5 km 
- **About 20 km** 
- About 50 km 

True or False: On average, the depth of the oceans below sea level is greater than the elevation of the continents above sea level
- **True** 
- False 

71% of the surface of the earth is water!

Warmer air holds more water, a lot of moisture is near the equator. 


Solid inner (iron 94%) core, same size of moon
Liquid other core, same size of mars
Mantle (oxygen, silicon, magnesium)
Crust (oxygen, silicon)

Why is iron concentrated in the core?
It's denser (Density = mass/vol), sinks faster

46% of the continental crust is oxygen, while only 21% of the atmosphere is oxygen. How could this be? 
- The crust has a lot of holes filled with oxygen gas 
- Volcanoes suck oxygen into the Earth’s interior 
- **Most of the crust is made up of solid **

Copper discovered 11k years ago
Gold 8k years ago

Continental crust differs from oceanic crust in which of the following characteristics:
- Thickness
- Density 
- Composition
- All of the above
