# Wisconsin is moving, and always has been. How do we know this?

Pair and Share: How would you determine that the continents of the Earth are moving?
I think you can dig up rocks and fossils and see if they are similar to other continents. 

Triangulation

- Need 3 satellites
- Send message and share time 
- Three circles, where do they match up?

Vectors (length, direction)

# Why does Plate Tectonics occur?

Tectonics: Large scale movements of earth's crust

Plate tectonics: Large scale movements of plates of earth's crusts

How did Alfred Wegener come up with the THE CONTINENTAL DRIFT HYPOTHESIS?:

- Continental Fit
- Fossil Distrubition 
- Similar Rock Patterns and Geologic Features (Stratigraphic Column)

How do ocean crusts/continents move?: **SEAFLOOR SPREADING**

Continental drift + sea floor spreading = plate tectonics

The Theory of Plate Tectonics involves which of the
following?:
A. Continental Drift and Evolution.
B. Seafloor Spreading and the Modern Synthesis.
C. Evolution and the Modern Synthesis.
D. **Continental Drift and Seafloor Spreading**
