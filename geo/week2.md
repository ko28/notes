All of the Geosci 100 “Road Maps”, “Pair & Share” exercises, and “Free Exam Questions” we answer during class. 

# Wisconsin is moving, and always has been. How do we know this?

Pair and Share: How would you determine that the continents of the Earth are moving?
I think you can dig up rocks and fossils and see if they are similar to other continents. 

Triangulation

- Need 3 satellites
- Send message and share time 
- Three circles, where do they match up?

Vectors (length, direction)

458 million years ago WI was a ~tropical~ paradise

# Why does Plate Tectonics occur?

Tectonics: Large scale movements of earth's crust

Plate tectonics: Large scale movements of plates of earth's crusts

How did Alfred Wegener come up with the THE CONTINENTAL DRIFT HYPOTHESIS?:

- Continental Fit
- Fossil Distrubition 
- Similar Rock Patterns and Geologic Features (Stratigraphic Column)

How do ocean crusts/continents move?: **SEAFLOOR SPREADING**

Continental drift + sea floor spreading = plate tectonics

The Theory of Plate Tectonics involves which of the
following?:
A. Continental Drift and Evolution.
B. Seafloor Spreading and the Modern Synthesis.
C. Evolution and the Modern Synthesis.
D. **Continental Drift and Seafloor Spreading**

# The 7 types of plate boundaries

Oceanic crust is made of basalt.

Continental crust is made of granite 

Ridge in the middle of oceanic crust, aka sea floor spreading, New crust is being made from magma. 

Absolute ages obtained from igneous rocks samples recovered from mid-ocean ridges reveal that:
A. rocks ages get older with greater distance from the axis of the spreading ridge
B. the pattern of rock ages is mirrored on each side of the spreading ridge
C. **all of the above**
D. None of these

At which kind of plate tectonic boundary is the upper
part of the mantle rising?
A. **Divergent boundaries**
B. Convergent boundaries
C. Transform boundaries

Why is molten magma rising to the surface at
divergent plate boundaries?
A. because it is more dense than the hotter rock around it
B. because it is affected by anti-gravity
C. **because it is less dense than the cooler rock surrounding it**
D. it is pure chance that magma rises at these boundaries

According to the reconstructed history of continental
movements you just saw, about when did the modernday Atlantic Ocean first begin to form?
A. About 750 million years ago
B. About 390 million years ago
C. **About 150 million years ago**
D. About 50 million years ago
