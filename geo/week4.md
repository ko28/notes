# What is an igneous rock?

Formed by cooling of molten material (magma) to the point of hardening to the point of hardening

Granite vs Basalt
| Difference | Basalt | Granite |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Color/composition | black | gray |
| texture/crystals | smooth/small crystals | bumpy/ large crystals |
| | extrusive | instrsive |
| | fast cooling | slow cooling |

# Igneous rock classification schemes

aphanitic = not visible
phaneritic = big crystal
porphyritic (phenocrysts + matrix) = big + small together
Two fundamental questions that we must address:

1. How do solid mantle and crustal rocks become molten magma?
2. How do igneous rocks crystallize from this molten magma?

What triggers the mantle melting that occurs beneath mid-ocean ridges?

A. Addition of water

B. Frictional heating

C. Increase in pressure

D. **Decrease in pressure** 


Considering Bowenâ€™s reaction series, how does the
process of fractional crystallization affect the
composition of a cooling mafic magma?

A. **The magma becomes more silica-rich.**

B. The magma becomes less silica-rich.

C. The magma becomes ultramafic.

D. None of the above.
