# The Rock Cycle

# What is a sedimentary rock?

What do lines in sandstone mean? IMPORTANT





# How do we make sedimentary rocks?

Weathering:

- Chemical Weathering

- Phyiscal Weathering

Erosion is then transported

Deposited into ocean

Buried

Lithifiied

Then u have a sedimentary rock!

# Main sedimentary rock groups

Types of sedimentary rock:

- Biochemical: composed of skeilital remains

- Chemical: inorganic percipitaion

- Silliclastic - fragments of silicate minerals

# Sedimentary rock classification schemes

Texture:

- Grain size

- Shape

- Sorting



Composition:

- Quartz

- Fledspar

- Calcite

- Shells





By the time sediments reach the ocean basins, they have
become:
A. angular and poorly sorted
B. very coarse grained
C. **well rounded and well sorted**
D. all of these
E. none of these

Which is a likely environment in which a quartz
sandstone could have been deposited?
A. A coral reef
B. Deep sea
C. **Coastal Beach**
D. None of the above

Which of the following is critical to the growth of coral
reefs?
A. sunlight
B. warm ocean waters
C. relatively calm seas
D. all of these
